Hopefully something incredibly simple to help a developer move serialized objects over a network with minimal lines and maximum 
efficiency. Written in Java.

As I go through creating some of this I will try and keep this doing only exactly what it's intended to do. I would like this 
library to be imported into a project and from there it will take less then five minutes to communicate with a server on the 
network keep a connection and close a connection. I will make the server overrideable and include with it only what is 
absolutely needed. The developer may need to add something to the server themselves.

About Ian:
I am a self taught programmer for the most part. I program in Java and other object oriented languages. I also use mark-up 
languages often. My code will most likely contain improper practices or errors in logic. This is a learning experience for me.
